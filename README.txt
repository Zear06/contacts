INSTALLATION : 
	- Edit the constants of the conf.php file.
	- Execute the `contacts.sql` in the correct database. Tables will be created and the sample account "joe:bretzel" will be created.
	- Some files will be included from the internet (react, jquery, pure.css), thus an internet connection is needed.

FUNCTIONALITIES :
	- Registration,
	- Login,
	- Search contact,
	- Add contact,
	- Delete contact,
	- Edit contact

TOOLS INCLUDED :
	- `React` as advised
	- `Pure.css` for good looking forms and buttons
	- `Font Awesome` for nice and lightweight icons

TASK DESCRIPTION :
	- develop a basic contacts management web application (e.g. address book)
	- should be able to add/edit/remove contacts
	- should be based on pure PHP / a PHP framework
	- you can choose any fields you'd like e.g. first name, last name, phone, email etc.
	- have basic persistence in a database of your choice where the user list is stored and edits are saved
	- UI choices and/or frameworks are entirely your choice. React JS would be preferable but just use whatever you're comfortable with.
	- you can host it locally on your laptop or upload it to a remote server
	- reload the page as rarely as possible when applying changes
	- there's no deadline, build it at your own pace and drop an email when you're done
